  <h1> All About Me </h1>

    <img src="img1.jpg">
  <p> I was born in a small village in Egypt on the cold evening of November 24, 2001 into a Coptic Orthodox family. My mother taught me love for education from a young age. Growing up, my favorite subject was Math and always knew that I would pursue a career in the field. I continued to strive and managed to be part of Calculus BC as a senior in high school. I applied to my dream university this year, MIT, and, miraciously, got accepted. I plan on studying Materials Engineering with the hopes of becoming a professor.   </p>

  <p> I will be graduating this year Salutatorian of my senior class. In college, I want to be involved with Engineers without Borders with the hopes of helping out less fortunate countries. I hope to be involved in research in the future, which is why I chose a career of academia. To create something with Materials Engineering would be a dream come true.  </p>
